# Dashiell Boyles

A puzzle solving enthusiast and determined junior software developer, and recent graduate from the Makers Academy bootcamp in London. Having spent the last five years working as a police officer in London, I am equipped to deal with challenging situations with a high level of focus, problem solving and passion, which I will bring to my career in software development. I look forward to working in a team, to build simple, effective and concise code and I relish the opportunity to improve my skillset, whilst working for a company who are passionate in their mission.

## Skills

#### Strong Communicator

With my background in policing, I have interacted with people from all walks of life. Often in challenging and stressful situations, I adapt my language and behaviours to the needs of individuals while treating everyone with respect. I have already proven capable of adjusting the language I've used in software development. When delivering a presentation on my final project at Makers to a variety of audiences, I adapted my approach to suit the needs of the audience. When delivering to an audience from technical backgrounds, I focused on the technical aspects on how we developed it. However when presenting to an audience including people from a non-technical background, I changed the language of my presentation to explain the technical terms in plain English.

(1:10 Start of the group presentation, 5:00 for my presentation)

#### Fast learner and time management

Whilst preparing for the Makers Academy I was working full time, therefore I planned my limited free time around my studies. As I had limited prior exposure to computer science concepts I wanted to ensure I was absorbing the materials effectively. I believe the ever evolving world of software and the need to constantly learn will come as no surprise to me. As a police officer I had to regularly learn new laws and keep abreast with any changes to existing legislation myself, often without any offical training delivered. 

#### Creative

Writing and directing short films for three years at university has nurtured my creativity. Working on a wide range of projects in my final year allowed me to contribute to a film from start to finsh or contribute to others already in production. In this case, I quickly got up to speed and aligned my goals with the group's to ensure the highest productivity. These skills have encouraged me to think outside of the box when writing code for programs from scratch and seeing possibility for improvement in existing designs.
