## Dashiell Boyles

A puzzle solving enthusiast and determined junior software developer, and recent graduate from the Makers Academy bootcamp in London. 

Having spent the last five years of working as a police officer in London, dealing with challenging situations has brought me a high level of focus, problem solving and passion to the start of my career in software development. Using skills I have gained from my previous career, I look forward to working in a team, to build simple, effective and concise code and I relish to the opportunity of improving my skillset, whilst working for a company who are passionate in their mission.

## Work Experience

METROLPOLITAN POLICE (April 2016 - January 2022)  
Police Constable

- Full time police officer working as a first responder to 999 calls and then as a firearms officer protecting key sites in London, which involved staying calm under pressure and making decisions in stressful situations.  
- Worked in an investigative role, involving sound, evidence-based decision making and problem-solving, bringing perpetrators to justice. 

- Strong team working and the ability to work calmly under pressure in a fast-paced environment.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

### Strong Communicator

With a policing background interacting with all types of people from all walks of life, very often in stressful situations. I learned to adapt my language and behaviours to the needs of individuals while treating everyone with respect. I have already proven capable of adjusting the language I've used in software development. When delivering a presentation on my final project at Makers, I understood the audience had a combination of people from technical and non-technical backgrounds, and so I delivered my topic in a way so all could understand.

(1:10 Start of the group presentation, 5:00 for my presentation)

### Fast learner and time management

Whilst preparing for the Makers Academy I was working full time, and having limited prior exposure to computer science concepts I had to effectively plan my limited free time around studying, and ensuring I was absorbing the material. I believe the ever evolving world of software and the need to constantly learn will come as no surprise to me. As a police officer I had to regularly learn new laws and keep abreast with any changes to existing legislation myself, often without any offical training delivered. 

### Creative

Writing and directing short films for three years at university has nourished my creativity. Working on a wide range of projects in my final year allowed me to contribute to a film from start to finsh and jump into others halfway through when needed, where I had to quickly get up to speed and align my goals with the group's to ensure the highest productivity. This transferable skill has encouraged me to think outside of the box when writing code for programs from scratch and seeing possibility for improvement in existing designs.

## Hobbies

I wanted a new challenge, where I could show my creative abilities and still be able to solve puzzles. After scrathing the surface of the software development world, it really appealed to me and I loved starting projects from scratch and seeing them flourish into life.
