A puzzle solving enthusiast and determined junior software developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy bootcamp. Having spent the last five years working as a police officer in London, I am equipped to deal with challenging situations with a high level of focus, problem solving and energy, which I will bring to my career in software development. I look forward to working in a team, to build simple, effective and concise code and I relish the opportunity to develop my skillset, working for a company who are passionate in their mission.

## Skills

#### Strong Communicator

With my background in policing, I have interacted with people from all walks of life. Often in challenging and stressful situations, I adapt my language and behaviours to the needs of individuals while treating everyone with respect. I have already proven capable of adjusting the language I've used in software development. When delivering a presentation on my final project at Makers to a variety of audiences, I adapted my approach to make it as accessible as possible to everyone. When delivering to an audience with a coding background, I used technical language, however when presenting to an audience including people from a non-technical background, I explained jargon in plain English.

(1:10 Start of the group presentation, 5:00 for my presentation)

#### Fast learner and time management

I thrive on variety and the challenge of working and learning in a fast-paced environment. I am well organised and experienced in working to tight deadlines and balancing competing priorities. I demonstrated this skill when working full time in the police and studying part time in preparation for the Makers Academy. As a police officer I had to deal with new problems every day and I responded positively and flexibly to resolve these, remaining calm and focused under pressure. I kept myself abreast of changes to legislation and operating procedures, often with no official training. This experience enabled me to adapt well to the demands of learning new skills at the Makers Academy, despite having had limited prior exposure to computer science concepts. I believe I am well-equipped to adjust to the ever-evolving world of software and the need to constantly learn. 

#### Creative

Writing and directing short films for three years at university has nurtured my creativity. Working on a wide range of projects in my final year allowed me to contribute to a film from start to finsh and to other films already in production. In the latter, I quickly got up to speed and aligned my goals with the group's to ensure the highest productivity. These skills have encouraged me to think outside of the box when writing code for programs from scratch and seeing possibility for improvement in existing designs.

#### Teamwork

Team work in the police and teamwork in Makers.
