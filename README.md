A puzzle solving enthusiast and determined junior software developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy bootcamp. Having spent the last five years working as a police officer in London, I am equipped to deal with challenging situations with a high level of focus, problem solving and energy, which I will bring to my career in software development. 

I look forward to working in a team, to build simple, effective and concise code and I relish the opportunity to develop my skillset. It is the sense of accomplishment on completing a project and knowing that I helped build it that I find most rewarding. I would like to work at a company working who share my goal of moving the world forward and are passionate in their mission of creating real, tangible benefits for society.

## Skills

#### Strong Communicator

With my background in policing, I have interacted with people from all walks of life. Often in challenging and stressful situations, I adapt my language and behaviours to the needs of individuals while treating everyone with respect. I have already proven capable of adjusting the language I've used in software development. When delivering a presentation on my final project at Makers to a variety of audiences, I adapted my approach to make it as accessible as possible to everyone. When delivering to an audience with a coding background, I used technical language, however when presenting to an audience including people from a non-technical background, I explained jargon in plain English.

(1:10 Start of the group presentation, 5:00 for my presentation)

#### Fast learner and time management

I thrive on variety and the challenge of working and learning in a fast-paced environment. I am well organised and experienced in working to tight deadlines and balancing competing priorities. I demonstrated this skill when working full time in the police and studying part time in preparation for the Makers Academy. As a police officer I had to deal with new problems every day and I responded positively and flexibly to resolve these, remaining calm and focused under pressure. I kept myself abreast of changes to legislation and operating procedures, often with no official training. This experience enabled me to adapt well to the challenges at the Makers Academy, where I had to quickly learn new languages in a short space of time, despite having had limited prior exposure to computer science concepts. I believe I am well-equipped to adjust to the ever-evolving world of software and the need to constantly learn. 

#### Creative

Writing and directing short films for three years at university has nurtured my creativity. Working on a wide range of projects in my final year allowed me to contribute to a film from start to finsh and to other films already in production. In the latter, I quickly got up to speed and aligned my goals with the group's to ensure the highest productivity. These skills have encouraged me to think outside of the box when writing code for programs from scratch and seeing possibility for improvement in existing designs.

#### Leadership and initiative

I am effective at identifying bottlenecks and prioritising tasks. During my degree, I was the director of a film production and having creative control of a project was a great experience. When filming on set as director, there are a host of issues to manage, and I calmly and clearly gave directions to my crew to ensure a smooth film shoot. For the first half of the week of our second project at Makers, my team was getting bogged down in trying to work around an overly-complicated MVP. Slow progress and approaching deadlines was causing the team to become demoralised and anxious. I took it upon myself to re-assess our MVP and re-prioritise tasks for the team to focus efforts on building a useable proof-of-concept app with mock banking data. In addition to leadership, communication was again key here and I believe this shift in priorities and working together reinvigorated morale and led to us to achieve our MVP by the end of the week.

## Experience

#### Metropolitan Police (April 2016 - January 2022)  
Police Constable

- Worked in an investigative role, involving sound, evidence-based decision making and problem-solving, bringing perpetrators to justice. 

- Strong team working and the ability to work calmly under pressure in a fast-paced environment.

#### Toriano Infant School (September 2015 - April 2016)
Teaching Assistant

- Worked in a classroom of 5 year old children, helping a select group improve their maths, writing and phonetics.

- Developed ways of teaching tailored to each individual child to improve their learning. Utilised the adaptability of my emotional intelliegence to empathise with the children and the adults I was working with in the classroom. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2022 - April 2022)
- 16 week highly intensive 16 week full-time software development bootcamp. 
- Focus on OOP, TDD, Agile working and Pair-programming.
- Designed and built numerous web applications in Ruby and Javascript, with an emphasis placed on pair-programming and self-learning, in order to efficiently work as a team and refine ideas and knowledge.

- Created a full stack app allowing refugees to find supplies not readily available at food banks in two weeks. Built with Express, Node.js, MongoDB for the backend RESTful API, with React on the front end. Unit testing carried out with Jest, frequent pair-programming. Naturally, a complex app came with obstacles and was therefore a great way to improve debugging skills.
- Created a CLI app which allows users to travel the London Underground system. Utilised with a heavy focus on TDD, which helped problem solve efficiently and solve challenges in an agile way.
- Regularly required to reflect and to evaluate learning process and communicate effectively to solve challenges in an agile way.
