## DASHIELL BOYLES

After five years of working as a police officer, I wanted a new challenge, where I could show my creative abilities and still be able to solve puzzles. After scrathing the surface of the software development world, it really appealed to me and I loved starting projects from scratch and seeing them flourish into life. 

Since January 2022, I have been studying the fundamentals of software development in a developer bootcamer at Makers Academy.
